# SuperMarket-ObjectDetection

Object detection is a task in computer vision that involves identifying the presence, location, and type of one or more objects in a given photograph.
In recent years, deep learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results for object detection, such as on standard benchmark datasets and in computer vision competitions. Notable is the “You Only Look Once,” or YOLO, family of Convolutional Neural Networks that achieve near state-of-the-art results with a single end-to-end model that can perform object detection in real-time.
